# SRT Generator Refactoring Summary - Phase 1

## Overview of Changes

The refactoring of the SRT Generator script has successfully implemented Phase 1 requirements, moving from word-by-word translation to segment-by-segment translation. This approach should yield better translation quality by providing more context to the translation engine.

### Key Changes Implemented

1. **Added New Configuration Parameters**:
   - `SEGMENT_MAX_PAUSE_SEC`: 0.8 seconds (max pause between words to end a segment)
   - `SEGMENT_MAX_WORDS`: 12 words (max words per segment before forced split)
   - `SRT_MINIMAL_BLOCK_PAUSE_SEC`: 0.05 seconds (minimal pause between split SRT blocks)
   - `SRT_MIN_DURATION_PER_BLOCK_SEC`: 1.0 seconds (minimum duration for any SRT block)

2. **Created BasicSegmenter Class**:
   - Segments word entries into coherent segments based on pause duration, max words, and punctuation
   - Each segment contains original words, original text, start/end times, duration, and translation status

3. **Refactored IdiomCsiMapper**:
   - Added `map_segments_for_idioms` method that works with segments instead of word entries
   - Matches entire segment text against idioms for better context-aware mapping
   - Maintains backward compatibility with `map_words_to_idioms` method

4. **Refactored TranslationEngine**:
   - Added `translate_segments` method that translates segments instead of individual words
   - Processes only segments marked as "NEEDS_NMT" (skips already mapped idioms)
   - Updates segments with translations and marks them as "NMT_TRANSLATED"

5. **Refactored SRTFormatter**:
   - Added `create_srt_from_segments` method that creates SRT blocks from segments
   - Implements splitting of long segments into multiple SRT blocks
   - Ensures minimum duration for SRT blocks and adds minimal pauses between blocks

6. **Reorganized Code Structure**:
   - Split monolithic script into modular components
   - Created a proper Python package structure with `__init__.py`
   - Separated configuration into its own module
   - Maintained backward compatibility with original command-line interface

## New Pipeline Flow

1. Extract and normalize audio using FFmpeg
2. Transcribe audio using Whisper to get word-level timestamps
3. **[NEW]** Segment words into coherent segments using BasicSegmenter
4. Apply idiom/CSI mapping to segments using IdiomCsiMapper
5. Translate segments using TranslationEngine
6. Format segments into SRT blocks using SRTFormatter
7. Save the final SRT file

## How to Use the Refactored Script

The refactored script maintains the same command-line interface as the original:

```bash
python -m srt_generator_refactor.main --video <path_to_video> --output <path_to_output_srt> --mapping <path_to_mapping_json>
```

## Testing Instructions

To test the refactored code:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install torch whisper transformers
   ```

2. Make sure ffmpeg is installed and available in the PATH.

3. Run the script with a sample video:
   ```bash
   python -m srt_generator_refactor.main --video sample.mp4 --output sample.srt --mapping idioms.json
   ```

4. Compare the output SRT file with one generated by the original script to verify improvements in translation quality.

## Future Improvements

While Phase 1 has been successfully implemented, there are several areas for future improvement:

1. **Enhanced Segmentation**: Implement more sophisticated segmentation based on linguistic features, sentence boundaries, or semantic coherence.

2. **Improved Idiom Mapping**: Extend idiom mapping to handle partial matches or fuzzy matching for better coverage.

3. **Optimized Translation**: Implement caching of common translations to improve performance.

4. **Better SRT Formatting**: Enhance the splitting of long segments to maintain semantic coherence.

5. **Additional Languages**: Extend support for languages beyond English to Indonesian.

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 refactoring has successfully transformed the SRT Generator from word-by-word translation to segment-by-segment translation, which should significantly improve translation quality. The code has been restructured to be more modular, maintainable, and extensible for future enhancements.
